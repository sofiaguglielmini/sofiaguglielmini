📊 Hi, I'm Sofia. I'm a stats PhD from Italy living in Belgium.

🌐 I work on reproducible inference for data-driven models, on high-dimensional networks and DAGs.

🧬 My interests include omics, health, and particle physics data. I mostly use R and Python.

Find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkMbz7IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiaguglielmini/).
